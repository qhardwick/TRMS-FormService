# TRMS: Form Service

## Project Description
The Form Service API for the Tuition Reimbursement Management System manages form data for the application. Users submit reimbursement request forms for business-relevant events they
would like to attend, including what it costs and how it relates to company business and then a hierarchy of approvers either grant or deny the request. Developed using an asynchrounous, non-blocking architecture.

## Features
* Uses Spring Weblux and RabbitMQ to handle all requests while maintaining an asynchronous, non-blocking architecture with loose coupling between services.
* Reimbursement requests can be submitted with reimbursement rate determined by event type, adjusted for User's current balance when required.
* Request forms pass through a hierarchy of approvers, from the User's direct supervisor to their Department Head and then finally to the Benefits Coordinator.
* If the User's direct supervisor happens to be the Department Head, supervisor approval step is skipped so that the Department Head need only approve the request once.
* User can optionally upload .msg attachments granting pre-approval from either their direct supervisor or from the Department Head. The attachment gets stored in an S3 bucket
  and the relevant approval stage is automatically skipped.
* The User may optionally store an attachment related to the event in pdf, png, jpg, txt, or docx format and it will be stored in an S3 bucket.
* The User may cancel any request that has yet to be awarded. If the request was in Pending status, the pending balance will be restored to their annual allowance.

To-Do List:
* Unit testing
* Error handling, particularly with regards to the message queues
* Settle on date and time formats
* Remove attachments and delete the contents from S3
* Implement User validation to restrict requests only to authorized users
* Utilize the response messages defined in the SystemMessages.properties file
* Pull the user's username from the request header and possibly use it to fill out the parts of the form that relate to the user and not to the event itself
* Inbox Service is yet to be defined and will likely need to refactor communication between it and the Form Service
* Either consolidate the cancel request and delete form methods into a single method or restrict the delete method to a user with elevated privileges

## Getting Started
1. Using your CLI tool, `cd` into the directory you want to store the project in.

2. Clone the repository using: `git clone git@github.com:TuitionReimbursementManagementSystem/FormService.git`

3. Configure your environment variables if you do not wish to use the provided defaults:
   * EUREKA_URL: The URL for the TRMS Discovery Service
   * AWS_USER: The AWS IAM username that has Keyspaces and S3 permissions
   * AWS_PASS: The password for the IAM User that has Keyspaces and S3 permissions

4. Create a Keyspace with the name: `trms` or choose one of your own by modifying the `CassandraConfig.java` file:
```
@Configuration
@EnableReactiveCassandraRepositories(basePackages = {"com.skillstorm.repositories"})
public class CassandraConfig {

    @Bean
    CqlSessionFactoryBean session() {
        CqlSessionFactoryBean cqlSessionFactory = new CqlSessionFactoryBean();
        DriverConfigLoader loader = DriverConfigLoader.fromClasspath("application.conf");
        cqlSessionFactory.setSessionBuilderConfigurer(sessionBuilder ->
              sessionBuilder.withConfigLoader(loader).withKeyspace("trms"));
        cqlSessionFactory.setKeyspaceName("trms");

        return cqlSessionFactory;
    }

    ...
}
```

5. The schema will be auto-generated when you run the program, but you can modify the auto-ddl statements by editing the `CassandraConfig.java`
   file in the `configs` package:
```
@Configuration
@EnableReactiveCassandraRepositories(basePackages = {"com.skillstorm.repositories"})
public class CassandraConfig {

    ...

    @Bean
    public SessionFactoryFactoryBean sessionFactory(CqlSession session, CassandraConverter converter) {
        SessionFactoryFactoryBean sessionFactory = new SessionFactoryFactoryBean();
        ((MappingCassandraConverter) converter).setUserTypeResolver(new SimpleUserTypeResolver(session));
        sessionFactory.setSession(session);
        sessionFactory.setConverter(converter);
        // Auto-ddl statement: CREATE, CREATE_IF_NOT_EXISTS, NONE:
        sessionFactory.setSchemaAction(SchemaAction.CREATE_IF_NOT_EXISTS);

        return sessionFactory;
    }

    ...  
}
```

6. Set up the Trust Store for AWS Keyspaces.
   #### Note: These commands do not work in Powershell! You will need to use a Bash terminal if using Windows:
   * `cd` into the `/src/main/resources` folder and run the following commands:
   * `curl https://certs.secureserver.net/repository/sf-class2-root.crt -O`
   * `openssl x509 -outform der -in sf-class2-root.crt -out temp_file.der`
   * `keytool -import -alias cassandra -keystore cassandra_truststore.jks -file temp_file.der`
   * Set the password to match the `truststore-password` set in the `application.conf` file: `p4ssw0rd`
   * Say `yes` to trust the certificate when prompted
  
7. Configure datastax in the `application.conf` file to set the `basic.contact-points` and the `local-datacenter` to the region where your Keyspace is located. By default,
   we have chosen `us-east-2`:
```
datastax-java-driver {

    basic.contact-points = [ "cassandra.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:9142"]
    basic.request.consistency = LOCAL_QUORUM
    advanced.auth-provider{
        class = PlainTextAuthProvider
        username = ${AWS_USER}
        password = ${AWS_PASS}
    }
    basic.load-balancing-policy {
        local-datacenter = "us-east-2"
    }

    advanced.ssl-engine-factory {
        class = DefaultSslEngineFactory
        truststore-path = "./src/main/resources/cassandra_truststore.jks"
        truststore-password = "p4ssw0rd"
    }
}
```


## Usage

1. Ideally all requests would be sent through the Gateway Service, which by default is configured for port `8125`. If sending requests to the Form Service server directly rather than through the Gateway Service we utilize port `8081`.
   This can be changed in the `/src/main/resources/application.yml` file:
```
{
  # Configure Netty server:
  server:
    port: 8081
}
```
2. While CRUD operations on the request form can be done independently, the approval processes rely on communication with the User Service. All microservices are configured to run on different ports by default and are connected to a
   cloud-hosted database, so you can still host the program locally but will need to run the Discovery Service, Gateway Service, User Service, Form Service, and Inbox Service simultaneously for full functionality.
3. Assuming you are hosting locally and sending requests through the Gateway Service, it functions as follows:


### Creating a new Reimbursement Request Form:
1. `POST` to `http://localhost:8125/forms`
2. With the request body:
```
{
    "username": "[String]",
    "firstName": "[String]",
    "lastName": "[String]",
    "email": "[String]",
    "time": "[HH:mm]",
    "date": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
    "location": "[String]",
    "description": "[String]",
    "cost": [Double],
    "eventType": "[String]",
    "gradeFormat": "[String]",
    "justification": "[String]"
}
```
3. In addition to the above required fields, you may optionally include any of the following:
```
{
  "passingGrade": "[String]",
  "hoursMissed: [Integer]
}
```
4. If a `passingGrade` is not supplied, a default passing grade will be used depending on the event type.
5. `eventType` must be entered as a String that conforms to the `eventType` enum defined in the Form Service. To view a list of acceptable values: `GET http://localhost:8125/forms/events` to produce the following response:
```
[
    "UNIVERSITY_COURSE",
    "SEMINAR",
    "CERT_PREP_CLASS",
    "CERTIFICATION",
    "TECH_TRAINING",
    "OTHER"
]
```
6. `gradeFormat` must be entered as a String that conforms to the `gradeFormat` enum defined in the Form Service. To view a list of acceptable values: `GET http://localhost:8125/forms/grade-formats` to produce the following response:
```
[
    "SCORE",
    "PRESENTATION",
    "PASS_FAIL",
    "OTHER"
]
```
7. The `date` field must conform to a date that is at least 7 days from today or the request will not be accepted.
8. A successful response will take the following form:
```
{
    "id": "[UUID String]",
    "username": "[String]",
    "firstName": "[String]",
    "lastName": "[String]",
    "email": "[String]",
    "time": "[HH:mm]",
    "date": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
    "urgent": [Boolean],
    "location": "[String]",
    "description": "[String]",
    "cost": [Double],
    "gradeFormat": "[String]",
    "passingGrade": "[String]",
    "eventType": "[String]",
    "justification": "[String]",
    "hoursMissed": [Integer],
    "attachment": null,
    "supervisorAttachment": null,
    "departmentHeadAttachment": null,
    "status": "CREATED",
    "reasonDenied": null,
    "excessFundsApproved": false,
    "reimbursement": [Double]
}
```


### Adding an Event-Related Attachment:
1. After the Request Form has been created, you may optionally add an event-related attachment prior to submitting it.
2. To do this, use the `id` returned in the response after creating the form and then `POST` to  `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/attachment` with a Body
  that is a file with extension: `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.txt`, or `.docx` along with a Header that includes the relevant `Content-Type`.


### Adding a Supervisor Pre-Approval Attachment:
1. After the Request Form has been created, you may optionally add a supervisor pre-approval attachment prior to submitting it to skip the supervisor approval step:
2. To do this, use the `id` returned in the response after creating the form and then `POST` to  `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/supervisor-attachment` with a Body
  that is a file with a `.msg` extension along with a Header that includes the relevant `Content-Type`.


### Adding a Department Head Pre-Approval Attachment:
1. After the Request Form has been created, you may optionally add a Department Head pre-approval attachment prior to submitting it to skip the Department Head approval step:
2. To do this, use the `id` returned in the response after creating the form and then `POST` to  `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/department-head-attachment` with a Body
  that is a file with a `.msg` extension along with a Header that includes the relevant `Content-Type`.


### Viewing the Event-Related Attachment:
1. After it has been uploaded, you may view the Event-Related Attachment associated with a Request Form by sending a `GET` request to the same URL that was used to upload it:
2. `GET http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/attachment`


3. ### Viewing the Supervisor Pre-Approval Attachment:
1. After it has been uploaded, you may view the Supervisor Pre-Approval Attachment associated with a Request Form by sending a `GET` request to the same URL that was used to upload it:
2. `GET http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/supervisor-attachment`


3. ### Viewing the Department Head Pre-Approval Attachment:
1. After it has been uploaded, you may view the Department Head Pre-Approval Attachment associated with a Request Form by sending a `GET` request to the same URL that was used to upload it:
2. `GET http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/department-head-attachment`


### Viewing a Request Form:
1. You can view and retrieve a request form using its `id` by sending a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}`


### Editing a Request Form:
1. You can edit a request form using its `id` by sending a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}` with the request body:
```
{
    "username": "[String]",
    "firstName": "[String]",
    "lastName": "[String]",
    "email": "[String]",
    "time": "[HH:mm]",
    "date": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
    "location": "[String]",
    "description": "[String]",
    "cost": [Double],
    "gradeFormat": "[String]",
    "passingGrade": "[String]",
    "eventType": "[String]",
    "justification": "[String]",
    "hoursMissed": [Integer]
}
```
2. Note: Every field listed in the body above will be overwritten by this edit method, whether you include them in the body or not. Optional excluded fields will be set to null. Mandatory
   excluded fields will cause a validation error. Any field not listed in the body above will be inherited by the Request Form as it already exists in the database.


### Deleting a Request Form:
1. You can delete a request form using its `id` be sending a `DELETE` request to `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}`


### Submitting a Request Form:
1. After it has been created, you may submit a reimbursement form for approval using its `id` by sending a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/submit`. The requesting user's `username` must
   be included in the request header as a field with the key: `username`
2. If the form did not contain a Supervisor Pre-Approval attachment and if the user's supervisor is not a Department Head, a message will be sent to the supervisor's Inbox for approval and the
   response body should show the request form has a status of `AWAITING_SUPERVISOR_APPROVAL`:
```
{
  ...
  "status": "AWAITING_SUPERVISOR_APPROVAL",
  ...
}
```
3. If the form did contain a Supervisor Pre-Approval attachment but not a Department Head Pre-approval, or if it contained no Pre-Approval attachments but the supervisor is also a Department Head, the
   supervisor approval step is skipped and a message will instead be sent to the Department Head for approval and the response body should show the request form has a status of `AWAITING_DEPARTMENT_HEAD_APPROVAL`:
```
{
  ...
  "status": "AWAITING_DEPARTMENT_HEAD_APPROVAL",
  ...
}
```
4. If the form contained both a Supervisor Pre-Approval attachment and a Department Head Pre-approval attachment, of if the user's supervisor is also a Department Head and the form contained
   a Department Head Pre-approval attachment, then both approval steps are skipped and a message will be sent to a Benefits Coordinator (Benco) and the request body will show the form with a status of
   `AWAITING_BENCO_APPROVAL`:
```
{
  ...
  "status": "AWAITING_BENCO_APPROVAL",
  ...
}
```
5. There are no Benco pre-approval conditions. The Benco approval must always be initiated manually.


### Approving a Request Form as a Supervisor:
1. If you are a user's direct supervisor, you may approve requests submitted to you by using the form's `id` and sending a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/supervisor-approve`. The approving
   supervisor's `username` must be included in the request header under the `username` key.
2. If the form did not contain a Department Head Pre-Approval attachment, a message will sent to the Department Head for further approval and the response body should show that the form's status has been updated
   to `AWAITING_DEPARTMENT_HEAD_APPROVAL`:
```
{
  ...
  "status": "AWAITING_DEPARTMENT_HEAD_APPROVAL",
  ...
}
```
3. If the form did contain a Department Head Pre-Approval attachment, the Department Head approval step is skipped and a message will instead be sent to the Benefits Coordinator for further approval and the
   response body should show that the form's status has been updated to `AWAITING_BENCO_APPROVAL`:
```
{
  ...
  "status": "AWAITING_BENCO_APPROVAL",
  ...
}
```


### Approving a Request Form as a Department Head:
1. If you are a Department Head, you may approve requests submitted to you by using the form's `id` and sending a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/department-head-approve`. The approving
   department head's `username` must be included in the request header under the `username` key.
2. A message will be sent to the Benefits Coordinator for further approval and the response body should show that the form's status has been updated to `AWAITING_BENCO_APPROVAL`:
```
{
  ...
  "status": "AWAITING_BENCO_APPROVAL",
  ...
}
```


### Approving a Request Form as a Benefits Coordinator:
1. If you are a Benefits Coordinator, you may approve requests submitted to you by using the form's `id` and sending a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/benco-approve`. The approving
   benco's `username` must be included in the request header under the `username` key.
2. A message will sent to the requesting user notifying them of approval and the response body should show that the form's status has been updated to `PENDING`. Depending on the form's projected
   `reimbursement` amount derived from the `cost` of the event and the rate as defined by the `eventType`, the `reimbursement` amount may be adjusted if the original projected amount exceeds the
   user's `remainingBalance` for the year: 
```
{
  ...
  "status": "PENDING",
  "reimbursement": [Double],
  ...
}
```


### Denying a Request Form:
1. Any user that is a part of the approver hierarchy can deny the request form once it is awaiting their approval. They can do this using the form's `id` by sending a `PUT` request to
   `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/deny` but they must also supply a reason for the denial in the request body:
```
{
  "reason": "[String]"
}
```
2. A message will be sent to the requesting user notifying them of the request denial and the response body will show that the form has been updated to contain the `reasonDenied` and its status will be
   updated to `DENIED`:
```
{
  ...
  "status": "DENIED",
  "reasonDenied": "[String]",
  ...
}
```


### Awarding a Reimbursement:
1. After the request has been approved, the user will need to show satisfactory completion of the event after the event has concluded. This can be in the form of a presentation delivered to the Department Head
   or demonstrating a passing grade to the Benefits Coordinator. Which one of these is true depends on the `gradeFormat` for the event listed on the request form.
2. The applicable Department Head or Benco can award the reimbursement by using the form's `id` and sending a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/award-reimbursement` and including the approver's
   `username` in the request header under the `username` field.
3. A message will sent to the requesting user notifying them of the award and the response body should show that the form's status has been updated to `APPROVED`:
```
{
  ...
  "status": "APPROVED",
  ...
}
```


### Canceling a Reimbursement Request:
1. So long as the request has not yet been awarded, the requesting user may opt to cancel a reimbursement request by using the form's `id` and sending a `DELETE` request to
   `http://localhost:8125/forms/{id}/cancel`
2. If the request form has a status of `PENDING`, the user's `remainingBalance` for the year will be adjusted to reflect the fact that they are no longer making the request. A form that has not yet reached the
   `PENDING` status will result in no change to their `remainingBalance` as their balance was not yet affected by the request to begin with. Any successful cancellation will also remove the request from the database.
